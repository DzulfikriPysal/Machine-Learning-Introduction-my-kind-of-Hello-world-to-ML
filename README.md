# Machine Learning Introduction: my kind of Hello world to ML
Using machine learning to predict the direction of a line using a simple model

This is just something that i done for learning and fun.
it kinda of my "hello world" to machine learning.
This code is to learn how to use tensorflow to build a machine learning model
and training / evaluate the model.
For this, i using supervised learning to develop the model
image 1 show the training data set start from second line that are provided for this model and image 2
show the evaluation data for evaluate the model in later process.
this data have 5 column where the first 4 column is for feature data while the last column is for 
expected output for the training data where "0" is for output 1 while "1" for output 2
